# optimizer

This project aims to build an optimizer for pytorch models.

This project follows code structuring of default pytorch code for any optimizer build in in python, as a starting point i used adam's code.

This optimizer performes well for MNIST data set. 

Also, it experiments with default convolution layer of pytorch. 

For example, normally data augmentation is done to input of model but what if we give data augmentation to each input of convolution layer? 
What if we multiply each convolution layers input to a random integer. Will it affect feature extration?
